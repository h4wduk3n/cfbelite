What is this?

This is a mod for NCAA Footbal 05 for gamecube that aims to update uniforms and other textures and bring the game up to date with current college football!

Who has worked on this?

To name a few, chloehotline, xflamexofxhopex, and h4wduk3n have all contributed to the project. (If I forgot your name ping me and I'll be sure to add it)

How do I install?

Place the textures folder into your Dolphin emulator's load/textures/GCEU69 folder.

Known issues/workarounds?

Some teams share textures and some teams have only one helmet texture. Therefore you may want to install specific subfolders at a time.  
Right now only Oregon uniforms are organized this way.
So for a specific set of Oregon uniforms only include that specific folder in your GCEU69 folder.

The team has been researching ways around this.
